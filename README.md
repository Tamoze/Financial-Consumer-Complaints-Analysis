**üìç State-Level Complaint Distribution**

![](https://github.com/Tamoze/Financial-Consumer-Complaints-Analysis/blob/main/10%20Top%20State%20with%20Highest%20Complaints.png)

  # üõ†Ô∏è Resolution Types

**üßæ Response Distribution Overview**

![](https://github.com/Tamoze/Financial-Consumer-Complaints-Analysis/blob/main/Responses%20Approaches%20for%20submitted%20complaints.png)

There are 5 different types of response approaches adopted from the chart:
- Closed with explanation is by far the most common response type, accounting for 41,044 complaints.
- Closed with monetary relief follows, representing 14,697 responses ‚Äî showing that in many cases, consumers were compensated.
- Closed with non-monetary relief was issued in 5,273 cases, indicating that adjustments or corrections were made without financial reimbursement.
- In progress responses stand at 1,494, showing a small number of complaints still under review.
- Only 8 complaints were marked as simply ‚ÄúClosed‚Äù, indicating that almost all cases were followed up with at least a basic resolution status.

*üí° What This Means:*
- The high number of ‚ÄúClosed with explanation‚Äù responses suggests that many complaints stem from misunderstandings or miscommunication ‚Äî an opportunity for better consumer education and clearer policies.
- Monetary and non-monetary relief combined (‚âà20,000 cases) highlights the importance of resolution integrity and fairness in customer service.
- The very low number of pending or unresolved complaints (<2.5%) reflects well on response efficiency but should still be monitored to ensure timely closure.

  # ‚è±Ô∏è Timeliness of Response
  
  **üìä Prompt Response Rate**

  ![](https://github.com/Tamoze/Financial-Consumer-Complaints-Analysis/blob/main/Prompt%20Response%20Rate.png)

  The chart shows that:
 - 93.77% of complaints received a prompt response, which shows a strong level of responsiveness by the organization.
- 3.84% were not responded to promptly, which may signal potential gaps in handling specific complaint types or workflow inefficiencies.
- A very small portion (indicated in yellow) is missing data, suggesting some issues in data recording or reporting consistency.

*üí° Insight:*
- Overall, the organization demonstrates excellent responsiveness. However, attention should be given to the few cases not promptly addressed, especially to understand any systemic causes or patterns.
- While most responses were timely, **untimely responses** were often linked to disputes or complex product categories.
- Delay patterns often appeared in **credit-related** complaints.

  ** üîÑ Top 10 Issues with Response in Progress**
  
  ![](https://github.com/Tamoze/Financial-Consumer-Complaints-Analysis/blob/main/Product%20with%20Response%20in%20Progress.png)
  
The bar chart reveals that the issues still being worked on include:
- Managing an account (380 cases) ‚Äì again appearing prominently, reinforcing it as a high-friction area.
- Opening an account (100 cases) and Problem with a credit reporting company's investigation (93 cases) also dominate.

  Other areas of issues with response in progress are:
- Closing an account	83
- Incorrect information on your report	80
- Other features, terms or problem	67
- Problem with a purchase shown on your statement	63
- Improper use of your report	62
- Problem caused by your fund being low	52
- Getting a credit card	50

*üí° Insight:*
- The majority of unresolved complaints revolve around account lifecycle issues ‚Äî from opening, managing, to closing ‚Äî and credit report accuracy. 
- This indicates ongoing friction in core banking operations, compliance reporting, and transactional clarity.

  **‚è≥ Top 10 Issues with Delayed Response**
  
![](https://github.com/Tamoze/Financial-Consumer-Complaints-Analysis/blob/main/Top%2010%20Issues%20with%20delayed%20response.png)
  
From the bar chart, the most delayed issues are:
- Managing an account (497 cases) ‚Äì the most affected, indicating a process or support bottleneck in account-related services.
- Incorrect information on credit reports (322 cases) ‚Äì this likely involves third-party verification delays.
- Problems with a purchase shown on your statement (197 cases) and Attempting to collect debt not owed (118 cases) are also notable.

   Other areas of issues with response in progress are:
- Closing an account	116
- Opening an account	107
- Problem with a credit reporting company‚Äôs investigation	99
- Problem with a lender or other company charging your account	99
- Fraud or scam	80
- Improper use of your report	80
  
*üí° Insight:*

The top delayed issues mirror the ‚Äúin progress‚Äù ones, with "Managing an account" again leading. Delay-prone complaints tend to involve third-party interactions, data disputes, or fraud investigations, which are more complex and time-consuming.

## ‚úÖ General Recommendations

**1. Proactively Manage High-Risk Complaint Categories**
- Prioritize resolution for frequently reported issues such as managing an account, incorrect credit report information, and fraud or scams.
- Introduce dedicated resolution workflows and specialized response teams to reduce delays and repeat complaints.

**2. Target Top States with High Complaint Volumes**
- Focus attention on complaint-heavy states like California, Texas, Florida, and Georgia.
- Allocate regional support resources, targeted consumer education, and policy adjustments to address regional drivers of dissatisfaction.

**3. Enhance Mid-Year Support Capacity (Q2‚ÄìQ3)**

Since Q2 and Q3 (April to September) register the highest complaint volumes, institutions like Bank of America should:
- Scale up customer service staffing during these months.
- Launch proactive outreach to address common seasonal complaint types.
- Ensure system reliability and uptime, especially for online and mobile banking platforms during this peak period.

**4. Boost Response Timeliness and Efficiency**

Although prompt response is generally strong, a significant portion of complaints remain "In Progress" or are resolved with delay.

Recommendations:
- Implement automated routing and triage systems to prioritize and speed up case handling.
- Conduct regular audits of delayed responses to identify root causes and resolve procedural inefficiencies.

**5. Monitor and Improve Product-Specific Complaint Channels**
- Allocate more attention to products with high complaint volumes.
- Encourage product and compliance teams to analyze recurring complaint trends.
- Update call center scripts and agent training to reflect the latest pain points and resolutions.

**6. Leverage Predictive Analytics**
- Use historical complaint patterns to forecast complaint surges by:

 Month, season, or product/service.
- Deploy AI-driven early warning systems to detect and respond to emerging issues in real-time.

**7. Strengthen Complaint Resolution Approaches**

A large proportion of cases are closed with explanations, which may not fully satisfy customers.
- Shift from reactive justification to proactive resolution strategies.
- Consider post-resolution feedback loops to improve quality and consistency.

**8. Improve Web-Based and Multichannel Experiences**

Since 72.66% of complaints come through web, ensure:
- User-friendly online forms, responsive mobile interfaces, and interactive complaint guides.
- Explore live chat and AI-powered assistants for real-time issue triage.

- Also enhance:
  
 Phone (7.49%) and email (2.11%) support capacity for customers less likely to use online tools.
 
 Streamline referral (17.22%) and web referral (0.14%) submissions through better partner integration.

**9. Improve Self-Service Resources**
- Develop robust and updated FAQs, tutorials, and chatbot support for frequent issues.
- Promote self-resolution tools during peak complaint months to relieve customer service teams.

**10. Customer Education Campaigns**
- Launch campaigns around March and April to:
- Educate users on fees, account features, and dispute resolution.
- Minimize misunderstandings that typically spike during Q2‚ÄìQ3.

**11. Evaluate and Scale Operational Changes from 2023**

The noticeable drop in complaints in 2023 indicates that implemented changes were effective.
- Conduct a retrospective review to assess which measures worked.
- Scale or replicate these best practices across departments, regions, or product lines.

**12. Establish a Continuous Improvement System**
- Integrate complaint analytics into a continuous improvement framework by:
